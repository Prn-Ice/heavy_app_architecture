# FAQ

## What version number to start with?

For a new project, your initial version number should be 0.0.1, until the first review release, at that time the version number should be around 1.y.z. Your version number must follow the semantic versioning specification ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)).

## Should I install fish, I see everyone using it?

Yes. Yes you should.

## Should I build UI first before integrating API's and external services?

If the API is still in it's early stages yes, definitely. Trying to integrate an API thats still very much in active development can be a pain, when you're building out the UI can lead to a lot of unused code.

If the API is ready, then its up to you, whatever works for you.
