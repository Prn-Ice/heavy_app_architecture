# Heavy Service

A Heavy service is a package that abstracts away reusable functionality eg 

- taking picture from a gallery or the camera
- displaying a loading indicator
- adding and removing files from storage

A typical heavy service looks like ðŸ‘‡

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ user_service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user_service.dart
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ i_user_service.dart
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user_service.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ user_service_test.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis_options.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pubspec.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ ...
```



## ðŸ§± Template

Creating heavy services manually requires quite a bit of boilerplate, I've created a brick template to help you create one faster.
